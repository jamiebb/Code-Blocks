CODE BLOCKS - Game

Getting Started:

  You need to choose at least one category of questions (HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript).

  You need to select the amount of players (either 1 or 2).

  The start button will only work once this is completed.

The Game:

  The goal is to build a "literal" code block. That means answering 9 questions correctly, filling in the 9 empty spaces. 

  Each correct answer will fill in a block. An incorrect answer will not.

  In Versus mode, each player will get the same amount of turns.

    For example, if Player 1 gets to 9 blocks first and Player 2 is at 8, Player 2 will still get his/her chance to get up to 9.

  If it is tied at 9, the game will go into sudden death. 
  
    If one person misses a question, the other player still needs to get it right to win.

Keyboard Shortcut:

  The text field will be focused on automatically on so you can start typing. Pressing Enter will send you to the next screen.
